# Lecture 4: Batch Machine Learning (Offline Learning)

A concise and well-structured overview of **Batch Machine Learning**, covering its core concepts, challenges, and disadvantages. These notes are ideal for **students, interview preparation, and quick revision**, and are adapted from my Notion study sheet.


## What is Batch Machine Learning?

Batch Machine Learning (also known as **Offline Learning**) is a learning paradigm where a model is trained on a **fixed, historical dataset** all at once. Once trained, the model is deployed and **does not update itself automatically** when new data arrives.

To incorporate new data, the model must be **retrained on a new batch** of data.


## Key Characteristics

- Training is performed on **historical data**
- Model remains **static after deployment**
- Retraining is done **periodically**
- Requires **complete dataset access** before training
- Widely used in traditional ML pipelines


## Typical Workflow

1. Data collection
2. Data cleaning & preprocessing
3. Model training on full dataset (batch)
4. Model evaluation
5. Model deployment
6. Periodic retraining with new data


## Problems in Batch Machine Learning

### 1. No Real-Time Learning

- Cannot learn from new data immediately
- Full retraining is required to update the model

### 2. High Retraining Cost

- Computationally expensive for large datasets
- Requires significant time and resources

### 3. Concept Drift

- Data distribution changes over time
- Model performance degrades if not retrained

### 4. Large Storage Requirements

- Entire historical dataset must be stored
- Becomes challenging for big data systems

### 5. Poor Fit for Streaming Data

- Not suitable for real-time or continuous data streams

### 6. Long Feedback Loop

- Errors are discovered late
- No immediate correction mechanism


## Disadvantages of Batch Machine Learning

- ❌ **Low adaptability** to new data
- ⏱️ **Delayed model updates**
- ⚙️ **Operational complexity** in retraining pipelines
- 📉 **Risk of stale models** over time
- 📦 **Scalability issues** with very large datasets


## When to Use Batch Machine Learning

Batch Machine Learning works best when:

- Data changes **slowly**
- Real-time predictions are **not required**
- Retraining cost is acceptable

### Common Use Cases

- Sales forecasting
- Credit risk analysis
- Spam detection (offline retraining)
- Recommendation systems (periodic updates)

## Batch ML vs Online ML

| Feature                | Batch ML | Online ML      |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Learning Type          | Offline  | Incremental    |
| Adaptability           | Low      | High           |
| Real-Time Updates      | ❌ No    | ✅ Yes         |
| Retraining Cost        | High     | Low per update |
| Concept Drift Handling | Poor     | Better         |

## Summary

Batch Machine Learning is simple and stable but lacks flexibility. It is best suited for **static environments** where data evolves slowly and immediate learning is not required.
